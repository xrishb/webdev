   <h1>CSS box model</h1>
   <h2>Introduction to Box Model</h2>
   <p>
      The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of:
   <ul>
      <li>margin: area around the border (outer area of an element), does not have background color.</li>
      <li>border: that goes around padding and the content, effected by the bg of the box.</li>
      <li>padding: area around the content (inner area of an element)</li>
      <li>actual content: the content</li>
      <li>element dimensions: Width and height</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Inline vs Block display</h3>
   <p>
      All elements are assigned a display property of either inline or block.
   <ul>
      <li>inline: horizontally placed elements such as links, media, etc.</li>
      <li>block: elements stack on top of the other as blocks.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Tips</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>A div is just a block element that we define ourselves.</li>
      <li>A span is an inline element.</li>
      <li>A class is a named collection of CSS properties used for span,div or any other element.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>

   <ul>
      <li>CSS box model only applies to the block elements and not to inline elements.</li>
      <li>if two block elements are next to each other and their margin is greater than 0, the larger of two margins
         will be applied.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
