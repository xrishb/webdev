    <h2>Introduction to DOM</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM is an interface that allows a programming language to manipulate
      the content, structure, and style of a webpage. JavaScript is the
      client-side scripting language that connects the DOM to an internet
      browser. The DOM is language-agnostic, and the browser is just a program
      that interprets HTML and CSS and renders it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to parsing HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation
      of a document, known as the Document Object Model. This model allows
      JavaScript to access the content and elements of a website document as
      objects. The DOM is modified by client-side JavaScript, and the browser
      automatically fixes errors in the source code.
    </p>

    <h2>DOM Tree</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM is often referred to as the DOM tree and consists of tree-like
      objects called nodes.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;a href="dom.html"&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Here we have an anchor element, which is a link to dom.html:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>`a`</strong> is the tag.</li>
      <li><strong>`href`</strong> is the attribute.</li>
      <li><strong>`dom.html`</strong> is the attribute value.</li>
      <li><strong>`DOM`</strong> is the text inside the anchor tag.</li>
    </ul>
